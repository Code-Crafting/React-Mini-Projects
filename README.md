## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
These are some of the projects I have built to strengthen my skills in front-end development and problem-solving.
Each project demonstrates practical implementation of concepts like state management, dynamic UI updates, recursion, and scalability in web applications.

| Folder Explorer | A project that simulates a file/folder structure where users can expand or collapse folders and create new files or folders dynamically. It strengthened my understanding of recursion and handling nested data structures. |
| Pagination      | A project that splits large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks. Built with custom hooks to keep the component reusable and highly scalable for applications like e-commerce platforms.                                |
| EMI Calculator  | A project that calculates monthly installments based on loan amount, interest rate, and tenure. It includes dynamic updates for down payment and EMI sliders, helping me learn how to manage complex state relationships.   |
