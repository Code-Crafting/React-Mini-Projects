## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
These are some of the projects I have built to strengthen my skills in front-end development and problem-solving.
Each project demonstrates practical implementation of concepts like state management, dynamic UI updates, recursion, and scalability in web applications.

| Project Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Folder Explorer              | A project that simulates a file/folder structure where users can expand or collapse folders and create new files or folders dynamically. It strengthened my understanding of recursion and handling nested data structures. |
| Pagination                   | A project that splits large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks. Built with custom hooks to keep the component reusable and highly scalable for applications like e-commerce platforms.                                |
| EMI Calculator               | A project that calculates monthly installments based on loan amount, interest rate, and tenure. It includes dynamic updates for down payment and EMI sliders, helping me learn how to manage complex state relationships.                                                                                                               |
| Password Generator           | A project that allows users to generate secure passwords based on custom preferences such as length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It gives users full control over the password composition and provides real-time feedback on password strength, enhancing both usability and security awareness.   |
| Tic Tac Toe                  | An interactive game where users can customize the board size, ranging from 3Ã—3 to larger grids like 4Ã—4, 5Ã—5, or 6Ã—6. This flexibility adds complexity to traditional gameplay and deepens understanding of dynamic UI rendering, game logic, and scalable winning pattern algorithms.                                                               |
